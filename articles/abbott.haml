  The leader of the opposition, Tony Abbott, was yesterday answering questions on the ABC's Q and A program. Mr Abbott was quizzed extensively on his criticisms of the Rudd Government's softening of Australia's border protection policies and how that criticism squared with his own strong Catholic faith. "Here's an excerpt":http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2010/s2864767.htm

<blockquote>Tony Jones: When it comes to asylum seekers, what would Jesus do? (applause)<br />
Tony Abbott: Well, Jesus wouldn't have put his hand up to lead the Liberal Party I suspect or the Labor Party for that matter.<br />
(applause)<br />
Don't forget Jesus drove the traders from the temple as well. Now...<br />
Tony Jones: What is the point of that?<br />
Tony Abbott: Well, the point is ...<br />
Tony Jones: What is the analogy?<br />
Tony Abbott: Jesus didn't say yes to everyone. Australia can't be a lifeboat to the world.<br />
</blockquote>

Abbott replied badly to Jones's cutting question, what the hell were you thinking. Firsly, Abbott is comparing himself, a political leader, to a religious leader, who was mistaken as someone who would lead the occupied region of Judea to military victory. If you understand anything about the Jesus and the New Testament, it should be that Jesus did not come to rule and take over. He talks about himself as a suffering servent, and repeatedly forshadows his death. This can be seen clearly throughout the New Testament, especially in Mark 8.31

<blockquote> Then Jesus began to teach them that the Son of Man (Jesus) must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and experts in the law, and be killed, and after three days rise again. 32 He spoke openly about this. So Peter took him aside and began to tell him not to say such things. 33 But after turning and looking at his disciples, Jesus rebuked Peter and said, "Get away from me, Satan. You are not setting your mind on God's interests, but on man's." </blockquote>

Clearly, if you've read the New Testament (and Abbott once trained to be a Catholic priest), you'd understand that Jesus's intent isn't a military victory, but a spiritual one. For Abbott to have confused this, comparing himself not only to God (Calling yourself Jesus is a little bit of a no-no in Christian circles), but an incorrect view of Jesus that first centuary Jews had, but shouldn't be had by anyone who has read what Jesus says about himself. But Abbott's wierd, semi blasphemous analogy gets worse. Abbott chooses a strange part of Jesus's ministry to pick up on; the time where Jesus cleared out money changers in the Jerusalem temple.  Money changers used dodgy scales that were rigged to get more money, something that God really hates. Listen to Amos 8.4

<blockquote>Listen to this, you who trample the needy, <br />
and do away with the destitute in the land. <br />
5 You say, <br />
"When will the Sabbath end, so we can open up the grain bins? <br />
We're eager to sell less for a higher price,  <br />
and to cheat the buyer with rigged scales! <br />
We want to mix in some chaff with the grain!"
</blockquote>

When Jesus cleared out the temple traders, he's rightfully angry that there are these hypocrites making money by ripping off people who've come to God's temple. We can draw out three things about these traders:

<ol>
<li>They use dodgy weights and double standards for personal gain. Recently, Abbott accused Rudd of trying to get political gain by <a href="http://www.independentweekly.com.au/news/national/national/general/rudd-exploiting-mackillop-sainthood-for-own-gain-abbott/1704485.aspx?src=rss">going to a Catholic service around the time of the canonisation of Mary MacKillop</a>. It sounds like a point, until you consider that Rudd did not make any announcements, or hold any press conferences. Abbott goes on to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t think any church service should be exploited for political purposes&#8221;. So Abbott thinks that Rudd shouldn&#8217;t be blowing his trumpet about going to a church service. He says this while&#8230; blowing his trumpet about Rudd going to a church service. God really hates people using double standards for their own gain.</li>
<li>They wrongfully use God&#8217;s name for personal gain. I&#8217;ve never heard of Rudd &#8220;holding media conferences outside churches&#8221;. Abbott certainly seems keen to score political points by mentioning faith though.</li>
<li>Money traders have no heart for the poor. God really hates it when these people get rich, but then &#8220;trample the needy&#8221;. One of the main issues God cares about throughout the bible is social justice. Jim Wallis, a prominent US minister who campaigns on social justice issues says that if you overlook social justice in the bible (as some conservatives do) you have <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-wallis/what-glenn-beck-doesnt-un_b_511362.html">to take out 2,500 verses talking about it</a>, and you end up with a &#8220;bible full of holes&#8221;. Abbott was mentioning Jesus when talking about how we don&#8217;t really need to be more compassionate by letting in refugees. (A sidenote; I don&#8217;t think that we need to let in all refugees either, but we could do a lot more in terms of real development aid oversees, not just employing Aussies to take part in activities abroad.)</li>
</ol>

Who do you think the Mad Monk seems more similar to, either God in the flesh, righeously telling hypocrites where they don't belong, or one of the shmucks out to make a quick buck on the side. In closing, Wallis presents a vision for a correct response to social justice;

<blockquote> We are all being called to a deeper commitment to Jesus Christ and to living out his kingdom of love and justice. A stronger and authentic voice with moral authority beyond mere partisan politics needs to be heard on social justice. That voice can both speak truth to power and bring people together across cultural and political lines to act for justice. </blockquote>
